The Business Requirements Specification documentation is based on the company  **Orum eventos corporativos**. The company bases itself on providing event planning services for small or large corporations. The company is looking to enhance its services by building a mobile web application to provide its clients with a better experience and keep them updated in real-time. 

## Skilled 

The BRS is a document that is created from the skills that I learn in CEN 3073 - Requirements Engr & Analysis.  While using critical thinking skills and using JIRA software as the place to document my information.
